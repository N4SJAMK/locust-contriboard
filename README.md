# To run thease tests with more than one machine

Make sure every machine has same version of locust and locust scripts

specify one machine to operate as master with command: 
```
locust -f locust-tests-new.py --master -H http://_targetaddresshere_/ TeamboardUser
```


In every slave machine use this command to operate as slave: 
```
